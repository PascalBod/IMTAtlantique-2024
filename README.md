# IMT Atlantique - RTOS for embedded devices

## Overview

This repository contains material used for the *RTOS for embedded devices* course, to be delivered at IMT Atlantique in January 2024.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> The course contains several practice sessions. In most of these sessions, some code will have to be written and run on a microcontroller board, the ESP-EYE. The Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with the IDF plugin will be used to edit, compile and build related applications.
> 
> Eclipse and the plugin must have been installed before the first session, and an "Hello World" application must have been run on the ESP-EYE board, to ensure that everything is working correctly.

Refer to these [instructions](prerequisites_instructions.md) to complete the prerequisites.

## Running an ESP-WHO example

ESP-WHO environnement, which allows to demontrate some ML applications on the ESP-EYE board, requires to run on an older version of ISP-IDF, for the ESP-EYE. Refer to these [instructions](esp_who_instructions.md) to install this older version of ESP-IDF and then to build and run an example.
